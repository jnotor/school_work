;
TOP:          ; A label. Labels are markers that allow program flow to jump to this point in the program.
MOV P1, #00H  ; Write all "0"s to Port 1. No leading zero required. NOTE: consuming 3 bytes
NOP           ; No operation. Effectively wastes 1 instruction cycles worth of time. NOTE: consumes 1 byte
MOV P1, #0FFH ; Write all "1"s to port 1. Note the leading '0' in the hex. constant and the '#' sign. NOTE: consuming 3 bytes
SJMP TOP      ; Jump to the label "TOP". Behaves like a "GOTO" statement. NOTE: consumes 2 bytes. can go forward 127 bytes or back 128 bytes
.END          ; Preprocessor directive. Tells the compiler that nothing is compiled beyond this line.
